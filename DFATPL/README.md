## Data description

DFATPL_Eclipse contains two files "history&tp" and "input_data", which are used in the experiments for the Eclipse project. Similarly, the file directory DFATPL_Mozilla contains the files used in the experiments for the Mozilla project.

```
1. history&tp -- the modified history and tossing path of bug reports.

(a) Bughistory_filter -- This file directory contains the modified history ("When," "Who," "What," "Added," and "Removed") of bug reports. It was obtained from "Bughistory.rar" by extracting the "What" field with "Assignee", "Status," and "Resolution."  

For example, the details of BugID=35 in the Eclipse project:
When                    Who             What    Added    Removed

(b) TossingPath.rar -- This file shows the tossing path of a bug report. Although all developers in a tossing path have participated in the fixing process of a bug report, the last developer in the path is the fixer who finally fixes the bug report. For example, in the file "8.csv" of the Eclipse project, the bug report ("BugID"=10407) is tossed out eight times until it is fixed.  

BugID	Dev1     Dev2  Dev3      Dev4          Dev5      Dev6        Dev7                Dev8

2. DFATPL_ProjectName_input: The input data for machine learning classfiers is included in this file directory. 

```
(a) feautres_input_TossingProb.csv -- The tossing probability between two developers are listed in this file.

(b) feautres_input.rar -- The feautres inputted to machine learning classfiers in our paper are included in this file.

(c) deldevs.csv -- This file includes developers who have very weak tossing ties.
```
