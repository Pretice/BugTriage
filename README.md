# BugTriage

This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61272111. To carry out the study of automated bug triage, we retrieved and collected 200,000 and 220,000 fixed bug reports of the Eclipse project and Mozilla project, respectively. For researchers who are interested in this dataset, you can feel free to download and use it. Also, if you think that it is useful for your work, please help cite the following papers.

In addition to traditional machine learning algorithms (such as SVM), we implemented deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). If you want to compare your own approach with these CNN-based algorithms (as baseline approaches), please refer to [the code](https://github.com/huazhisong/graduate_text) written by [Huazhi Song](https://github.com/huazhisong) and cite the following paper.
